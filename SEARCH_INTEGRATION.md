# Search Functionality Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated server-side search functionality for the Reception Dashboard across all three appointment sections: All Appointments, Today's Appointments, and Pending Payments.

## Updated API Endpoints

### 1. Get All Appointments by Salon and Branch (With Search)
```
GET /api/v1/appointments/salon/{salonId}/branch/{branchId}?search={query}&page={page}&size={size}
```

### 2. Get Today's Appointments by Salon and Branch (With Search)  
```
GET /api/v1/appointments/salon/{salonId}/branch/{branchId}/today?search={query}&page={page}&size={size}
```

### 3. Get Pending Payments by Salon and Branch (With Search)
```
GET /api/v1/appointments/salon/{salonId}/branch/{branchId}/pending-payments?search={query}&page={page}&size={size}
```

## API Service Changes

### Updated Methods:
- `getAllAppointmentsForSalon()` - Added optional `search` parameter
- `getTodayAppointments()` - Added optional `search` parameter  
- `getPendingPaymentAppointments()` - Added optional `search` parameter

### Updated Interface:
- `AppointmentListResponse` - Added snake_case properties to support Spring Boot pagination format:
  - `total_pages`, `total_elements`, `number_of_elements`
  - `content`, `first`, `last`, `empty`

## Frontend Changes

### New State Management:
```typescript
const [searchQueries, setSearchQueries] = useState({
  all: '',
  today: '',
  pending: ''
});
```

### New Search Functions:
- `handleSearchChange()` - Updates search query state
- `performSearch()` - Triggers API call with search parameter
- `clearSearch()` - Clears search and reloads without filter

### UI Enhancements:
- Added search input fields with search icons for all three sections
- Added clear search buttons (X icon) when search is active
- Enter key support for executing search
- Real-time search state management per section
- Server-side search instead of client-side filtering

### Updated Pagination:
- All pagination handlers now preserve search queries when changing pages
- Search parameters are included in all data refresh operations
- WebSocket refresh operations maintain current search state

## Search Functionality

### Search Criteria:
- **Customer Name**: Case-insensitive partial match on first name and last name
- **Phone Number**: Exact partial match on any part of the phone number
- **Combined Search**: Searches both name and phone simultaneously (OR condition)

### Search Behavior:
- **Real-time**: Search executes on Enter key press or clear button
- **Persistent**: Search queries are maintained during pagination
- **Section-specific**: Each appointment section has independent search
- **Server-side**: All filtering happens on the backend for better performance

## Technical Implementation

### Removed Client-side Filtering:
- Removed `searchAppointments()` function
- Removed filtered arrays (`filteredPendingPayments`, etc.)
- Direct use of API response data
- Removed date filter functionality (to be implemented later if needed)

### Updated Function Calls:
- All `loadAppointments()`, `loadTodayAppointments()`, and `loadPendingPayments()` calls now include search parameters
- Pagination handlers preserve search state
- Refresh operations maintain current search queries

## Usage Instructions

### For Receptionists:
1. **Search by Name**: Type customer's first or last name in search box
2. **Search by Phone**: Type any part of the phone number
3. **Execute Search**: Press Enter or click search button
4. **Clear Search**: Click the X button to remove search and show all results
5. **Navigate Results**: Use pagination while maintaining search filter

### For Developers:
1. Search parameters are automatically added to API calls
2. Empty/null search parameters are handled gracefully
3. Pagination maintains search state
4. All three appointment sections work independently

## Files Modified

### API Service:
- `src/services/api.ts`
  - Updated method signatures with search parameter
  - Enhanced logging with search information
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces

### Reception Dashboard:
- `src/components/reception/ReceptionDashboard.tsx`
  - Added search state management
  - Added search handler functions
  - Updated UI with search inputs
  - Updated all function calls to include search parameters
  - Removed client-side filtering logic

## Testing

The application starts successfully on `http://localhost:5174/` and all search functionality is ready for testing:

1. Navigate to Reception Dashboard
2. Use search inputs in any of the three sections
3. Test search by customer name and phone number
4. Verify pagination works with search filters
5. Test clear search functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Date Range Filtering**: Could be added as additional search parameter
2. **Advanced Filters**: Status-based filtering, service-based filtering
3. **Search History**: Remember recent searches
4. **Search Suggestions**: Auto-complete based on existing customer data
5. **Export Filtered Results**: Export search results to PDF/Excel
